        <h3>Javascript Objects</h3>
        <p>Javascript objects are variables that can contain many values. An object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.</p>
        <p>Objects can be created using object literals, constructor functions, or the Object.create() method.</p>
        <p>Example of an object literal:</p>
        <p id="demo"></p>
        <script>
          var person = {
